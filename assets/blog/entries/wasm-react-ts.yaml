title: Setting up a WASM + React + TypeScript project
contents: |
  I love writing [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) code. Recently, I've gained
  interest in using Rust for web development, via web assembly (WASM). It turns
  out setting up WASM with React and TypeScript is harder than it looks--that's
  why I'm writing this post.

  # Setup
  ```rust
  fn hello() -> i8 {
    println!("{}", err);
  }
  ```
